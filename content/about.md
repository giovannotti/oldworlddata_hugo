Which insights could we gain from data science and probability theory for archeology and history?

This site was created to build a bridge between the scientific fields of archeology, history, the theory of historical cultural studies on the one hand and statistics, probability theory, data science on the other.

Data guys may find interest in the peculiarity of historical tradition: records, informations and data of sparseness and incompleteness. Whereas, cultural scholars could hopefully understand the power of analyzing cultural historical informations mathematically, where human mind is reaching its computational limits.

<!--Despite my graduate background of archeology, art history and classics I started to focus massively on statistics, data science and probability theory during the occupation with my archeological doctoral thesis. This was the start of a scholastic borderline.-->
